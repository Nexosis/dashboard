# Nexosis Community Code of Conduct
Nexosis is dedicated to providing a safe, inclusive, welcoming, and harassment-free experience for all community participants -- including when we collaborate on open-source software. Our Code of Conduct exists because of that dedication. You can view our full Code of Conduct [here](https://github.com/Nexosis/community-code-of-conduct/blob/master/long-form-code-of-conduct.md#long-form-code-of-conduct) and see guidelines for reporting misconduct [here](https://github.com/Nexosis/community-code-of-conduct/blob/master/incident-reporting.md).
