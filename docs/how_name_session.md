##### How to name your session
Name your session something descriptive yet memorable so that you can easily recall the purpose of each session. 

If you don't provide a name, we'll generate one based on the class of algorithm and the name of the data source. For example if you run a *Classification* session on the *Iris* data source then your session will be named 'Classification on Iris'. Session names are not required to be unique.
