#### Getting Started with Sessions
Looks like you don't have any sessions yet. A session is a request to have the Nexosis API do work - such as building a model or forecasting a time-series prediction. 

To get started with sessions in the Dashboard simply click over to your [*DataSets*](#/data) and then click *Start Session* on any DataSet in the list. The session start wizard will walk you through the information we need to get started and you'll be on your way. Once you have a session or two you can always come back here to find them.

You can read more about sessions and what they do [in our online guides](https://docs.nexosis.com/guides/sessions)
