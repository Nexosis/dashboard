##### Why choosing a key is important
Providing a key for your DataSet will allow you to make updates to your DataSet. When a key is available we'll also return it to you in results which can help with correlating results with original values. 

Don't worry if you don't have a key; we'll make one up so we can keep things straight behind the scenes. But we don't use those keys in other API requests or return them to you. 

**If you plan on having a key, then it must be provided when the DataSet is created as we won't allow you to set that role later.**
