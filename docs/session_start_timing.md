##### <strong>How long will my Session run?</strong>
The amount of time you spend waiting for a session to run will vary based on a few factors. The greatest predictor of time will be how much data is in your dataset overall. 

Most of the datasets in our sample data will run between 5 and 10 minutes. However, we also queue work for community tier users which can cause you to wait a few additional minutes. 

Finally, time-series algorithms take a bit longer to run and can often take 15-20 minutes even when running with our sample data. If you've been waiting more than hour while using datasets within the community tier limit of 10Mb, then we would like to hear from you as something unexpected may have happened to your session.
