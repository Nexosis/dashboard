##### Forecasting start and end dates
Selecting a start and end date sets the period of time over which you want to generate forecasts

This dataset has dates ranging from <span class="number">{0}</span> to <span class="number">{1}</span>. Typically you'll want to choose a forecast length which is far shorter than your overall dataset length. The Nexosis API will require at least 14 days prior to your forecast start date and that your dataset contains at least double the number of observations in the overall forecast length. For example, if you want to forecast 30 days into the future then you will need 60 days of data in your dataset prior to the forecast start date.
