#### Getting Started with Models
Models allow you to obtain predictions based on what our algorithms built for you during a Session run on one of your DataSets. To get started with models, click back over to your [*DataSets*](#/data) and then click *Start Session* on any DataSet in the list. We build models when you choose a Classification, Regression, or Anomaly Detection session.

You can return here to find your model after your session has **completed**.  At that point you'll be ready to predict and see how well you think the model performs on real world data.

You can read more about the model building process [in our online guides](https://docs.nexosis.com/guides/how-it-works-classification).
